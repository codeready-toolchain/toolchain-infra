= Pre-requisites

== Install AWS CLI

You can find more information about how to install `aws` CLI [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv1.html) OR Simply install using following bash commands:

[source,bash]
----
curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip" -o "tmp/awscli-bundle.zip"
unzip /tmp/awscli-bundle.zip
sudo ./tmp/awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws
----

Verify that `aws cli` is installed correctly usig `aws --version`

== Configure AWS

=== Configuring Profiles

==== Toolchain permanent cluster

Toolchain AWS already has robot account `crt-robot`  with required minimum permissions to create Openshift cluster.
With available access and secret key configure AWS profile by name `crt-robot` using following

[source]
----
aws configure --profile crt-robot
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: je7MtGbClwBF/2Zp9Utk/h3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name [None]: us-east-2
Default output format [None]: text
----

==== 48 Hrs temporary cluster

If you want to setup toolchain on 48 hrs temporary cluster, you should configure AWS with profile `openshift-dev` using following

[source]
----
aws configure --profile openshift-dev
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: je7MtGbClwBF/2Zp9Utk/h3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name [None]: us-east-2
Default output format [None]: text
----

== Install openshift-installer
We need to setup `openshift-install` binary to create Openshift cluster

[source]
----
wget https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/openshift-install-linux-4.2.4.tar.gz -P /tmp/
tar -xvf /tmp/openshift-install-linux-4.2.4.tar.gz --directory /tmp
sudo mv /tmp/openshift-install /usr/local/bin/
----

You can download latest openshift-installer from https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/

== Set Required environment variables

=== CLIENT_SECRET

To setup RHD Identity Provider, you need to register a client with RHD and with client's secret, create a secret in `openshift-config` namespace to be used by OAuth cluster config.
So to create required secret, user needs to set `CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable to it's base64 encoded value.

[source]
----
export CLIENT_SECRET=base64_encoded_client_secret
----

=== ISSUER

If you want to setup different Identity Provider, e.g. your hosted keycloak, you need to use the issuer URL which is publicly exposed route for your keycloak
[source]
----
export ISSUER=your_issuer_url
----

If you haven't not set this variable, script will use default issuer i.e. "https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external" which points for RH SSO

=== PULL_SECRET
We are storing host, member and 48 hrs temp clusters configuration files under `/config` directory, for which we need pull secrets to be set by environment varibale `PULL_SECRET`

[source]
----
export PULL_SECRET='{"auths":{"cloud.openshift.com":{"auth":"HSADJDFJJLDFbhf345==","email":"toolchain@redhat.com"},"quay.io":{"auth":"jkfdsjfTH78==","email":"toolchain@redhat.com"},"registry.connect.redhat.com":{"auth":"jhfkjdjfjdADSDS398njdnfj==","email":"toolchain@redhat.com"},"registry.redhat.io":{"auth":"jdfjfdhfADSDSFDSF67dsgh==","email":"toolchain@redhat.com"}}}'
----

You can download/copy required pull_secret from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/aws/installer-provisioned

==== SSH_PUBLIC_KEY
We need to add ssh keys under authorized keys for all the nodes created by the installer, for which we are passing ssh public keys by setting environment variable `SSH_PUBLIC_KEY`

[source]
----
export SSH_PUBLIC_KEY="ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAklOUpkDHrfHY17SbrmTIpNLTGK9Tjom/BWDSUGPl+nafzlHDTYW7hdI4yZ5ew18JH4JW9jbhUFrviQzM7xlELEVf4h9lFX5QVkbPppSwg0cda3Pbv7kOdJ/MTyBlWXFCR+HAo3FXRitBqxiX1nKhXpHAZsMciLq8V6RjsNAQwdsdMFvSlVK/7XAt3FaoJoAsncM1Q9x5+3V0Ww68/eIFmb1zuUFljQJKprrX88XypNDvjYNby6vw/Pb0rwert/EnmZ+AW4OZPnTPI89ZPmVMLuayrD2cE86Z/il8b+gw3r3+1nKatmIkjn2so1d01QraTlMqVSsbxNrRFi9wrf+M7Q== schacon@mylaptop.local"
----

== Setting up Toolchain on Host and Member cluster
To setup a hosted toolchain on multiple clusters (currently we are using 2 clusters i.e. host and member), We need to do following things

1. Create host and member cluster
2. Setup RHD identity provider
3. Create admin users with `cluster-admin` roles
4. Remove self-provisioner cluster role from authenticated users
5. Deploy registration service, host-operator on host cluster
6. Deploy member-operator on member cluster
7. Create/setup KubeFedCluster

=== With Single step

==== Permanent Clusters
In order to achieve all above things on permanent clusters use following

[source,bash]
----
./setup_toolchain.sh
----

===== Overwriting Operator's namespace
If you want to overwrite operator's namespace, you can use respective flags like following:

[source,bash]
----
./setup_toolchain.sh -hs my_host_ns -mn my_member_ns
----

==== 48 Hrs Dev clusters
In order to achieve all above things on temporary clusters for 48 hrs, use following

[source,bash]
----
./setup_toolchain.sh -d
----

=== With Multiple steps
==== With default namespace for operators
If you want to try this setup one step at a time, you can follow the following steps:
[source, bash]
----
./setup_cluster.sh -t host
./setup_cluster.sh -t member
./setup_kubefed.sh
----

==== With overriding operators namespace
If you want to overwrite operators namespace, you can use respective flags or environamene variable
like following steps:
[source, bash]
----
./setup_cluster.sh -t host -hs my_host_ns -mn my_member_ns
./setup_cluster.sh -t member -hs my_host_ns -mn my_member_ns
./setup_kubefed.sh
MEMBER_OPERATOR_NS=my_member_ns HOST_OPERATOR_NS=my_host_ns ./setup_kubefed.sh
----

== Cleaning UP Default kubeadmin
Once host and member clusters are setup with all required things and you confirm that all crt-admin can login and they have required access for cluster scoped resources
you can remove default kube-admin user using following step:
[source, bash]
----
oc delete secret kubeadmin -n kube-system
----

== Destroying cluster

Make sure to export required AWS profile.

- If your cluster is created for 48 hrs then `export AWS_PROFILE=openshift-dev`
- If your cluster is permanant cluster, then `export AWS_PROFILE=crt-robot`

=== From the directory which stores metadata for Openshift 4 Cluster

[source,bash]
----
openshift-install destroy cluster
----

=== If you lost metadata required to destroy Openshift 4 Cluster

If the OpenShift 4 cluster are deployed by installer and you lost the metadata, there is no way to delete the cluster using the OpenShift installer without the metadata
In order to destroy the cluster using the installer, you should generate metadata.json file.

==== Set required variables using following
[source,bash]
----
CLUSTER_NAME=NAME
AWS_REGION=REGION
CLUSTER_UUID=$(oc get clusterversions.config.openshift.io version -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterID}{"\n"}')
INFRA_ID=$(oc get infrastructures.config.openshift.io cluster -o jsonpath='{.status.infrastructureName}{"\n"}')
----

==== Generate metadata.json
[source,bash]
----
echo "{\"clusterName\":\"${CLUSTER_NAME}\",\"clusterID\":\"${CLUSTER_UUID}\",\"infraID\":\"${INFRA_ID}\",\"aws\":{\"region\":\"${AWS_REGION}\",\"identifier\":[{\"kubernetes.io/cluster/${INFRA_ID}\":\"owned\"},{\"openshiftClusterID\":\"${CLUSTER_UUID}\"}]}}" > metadata.json
----

==== Destroy cluster with the generated metadata.json file

[source,bash]
----
openshift-install destroy cluster
----
